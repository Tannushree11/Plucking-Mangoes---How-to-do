Classes to be created - ground.js , launcher.js , mango.js , stone.js , tree.js
To create the classes take reference from the angry bird class activity.

Create around 10-12 objects for mangoes. Call each object with display function in function draw()

Also create the following objects in finction setup()
treeObj=new tree(1050,580);
	groundObject=new ground(width/2,600,width,20);
	launcherObject=new launcher(stoneObj.body,{x:235,y:420})
